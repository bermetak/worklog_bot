My pet project that I made at 2019

Telegram bot, you can add to group chat to track employees worktime and latenesses.

Bot commands:\
/new *First name* *Last name* -- adds new employee with given name to database;\
/report -- sends to group Excel file with full timesheet for all employees for the current month.


Using: \
Python3.7\
Flask1.1\
